# User Submissions

## Introduction

This directory contains the top performing user-submitted authenticated microservices for each programming language. 

## Notes

- You should never submit a pull request that edits any files in this directory.
- The results of the benchmarks will be aggregated and presented in a nice format in the [LangWars](https://langwars.com) website in the future.
- Only the top performing submission for every language will be presented here so that it can be compared with submissions from other languages.
