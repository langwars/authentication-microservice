# auth_test

This project runs a set of tests on the running authentication microservice
that runs on port 3000 to verify that it follows the requirements for the
benchmark. If your authentication microservice can pass these tests, it can
be a part of our benchmarks.

To run:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.42. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
